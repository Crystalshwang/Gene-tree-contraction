# Gene-tree-contraction
This is final project for ECE 208. Our group member is Xin Li, Sihan Wang, Yawen Zhao and Jiahao Zhu.

To evaluate the performance of aLRT with different parameters, we use Robinson-Foulds metric to calculate the distance between the estimated species tree and real species tree and compare the performance of situations with and without aLRT, and with aLRT of different parameters.
